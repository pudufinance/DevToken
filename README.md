# Decentralized Application
This is a repository built while writing an article on my blog on Medium.  

The article for this branch can be found [here](https://itnext.io/using-a-smart-contract-in-an-web-application-78432ed68527)
The repository showcases how a DApp can look like.  

In the Repository you will find a custom built BEP-20 Smart contract that has  
staking and rewarding mechanisms in place. 

Also a UI to handle the token in a VERY VERY rudamental way, only to show how to connect.
